      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Ruei-Lin Lin. I am a graduate student at the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University.
        Working at the Digital image and siginal processing lab.
        I aim to keep building T-shaped knowledge while being a builder who loves to create. My current focus is digital
        signal processing research and software proof-of-concept development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a non-linear path from electrical engineering—through consulting and entrepreneurship competitions, then
        Web3 development—before returning to electrical research. I'm deeply interested in business analytics, project
        management, image processing, and I continue to build experience across these domains.
      </p>

      <h2>Ideas I've Explored</h2>
      <h3>EquiPilot：</h3>
      <p>
        A Web3 equity allocation calculator that integrates smart contracts and a front-end UI to improve transparency for
        early-stage startups and collaboration with Web2 talent.
      </p>
      <h3>ARtisan：</h3>
      <p>
        Using AR modeling to provide real-time interactive experiences for consumers, improving retail efficiency and
        customer engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe Web3 will be the next mega trend and will change the way we live. I hope to apply my expertise in this
        field and create better products and services with like-minded people.
      </p>
